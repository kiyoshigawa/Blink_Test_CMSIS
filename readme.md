This is a repo that's tracking my project as I learn to code bare-metal arm code. I started with a simple blink project, and intend to work through setting up a custom Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) for the various peripherals on an STM32F070F6 chip in an effort to teach myself embedded arm programming.

I'm using the official CMSIS library provided by ST, as well as a modified version of their linker scripts and startup code as generated by STM32CubeMX, but the rest is my code.
